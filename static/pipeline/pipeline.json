By default rowBuffer is 20, so if you have row spans with more than 20 rows, that will cause the issue. \r\n\r\nYou can fix this by setting the rowBuffer property to a value equal or bigger than the number of rows in the largest row span you have. For example, so if your biggest row span is 100 rows, set rowBuffer to 100 to resolve this as shown here:\r\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/syUbfeLUnYFEXhxJ\r\n\r\nNote that in this example the row span is correctly shown as you scroll down.\r\n\r\nThe rowBuffer property is documented here:\r\nhttps://www.ag-grid.com/documentation/javascript/grid-properties/\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that using a larger value for rowBuffer will increase the memory footprint, as it pre-renders a larger number of rows before they're scrolled into view.","deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2321","issueType":"Bug","summary":"Colspan is not recalculated when using delta row data","versions":[],"status":"Backlog","resolution":null,"features":["Cell_Rendering"],"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2318","issueType":"Task","summary":"[Row Pinning] Allow to configure separate renderers for top and bottom pinned row area","versions":[],"status":"Backlog","resolution":null,"features":["Row_Pinning"],"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2314","issueType":"Task","summary":"Take rowClass into consideration when using autoheight","versions":[],"status":"Backlog","resolution":null,"features":["Row_Height"],"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2313","issueType":"Task","summary":"[Side Bar] Remove DOM elements from the side bar is the side bar is hidden","versions":[],"status":"Backlog","resolution":null,"features":["Side_Bar"],"moreInformation":null,"deprecationNotes":null,"breakingChangesNotes":null,"documentationUrl":null},{"key":"AG-2311","issueType":"Task","summary":"[Row Selection] Allow a new property that will deselect all rows when using headerCheckboxSelectionFilteredOnly = true.
